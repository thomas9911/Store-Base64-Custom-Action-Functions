# Upload base64-encoded file URL

This repository hosts the code for the custom actions steps found in the [Upload base64](https://my.bettyblocks.com/block-store/0a0eb6ab-531d-4045-bc46-a8ef943c1e84) from the Betty Blocks block store. It works exactly the same as the native StoreFile function, but instead of the file URL you can pass in the base64-encoded version of a (temp) file URL.
